# CodeNamer
This app is intended as a tool to help Spymasters generate clues for Codenames. Users first take a picture of the 5x5 board as well as the color keycard and can then generate clues from a virtual representation of the boardstate.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the development server:
```
npm start
```
